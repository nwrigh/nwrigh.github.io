<h1 id=tldr>TLDR;</h1>
<p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-wrightson-b2707a1/>My LinkedIn</a> &mldr;. No emotional reasons behind my career choices lay here though!</p>
<h1 id=the-longer-version>The long(er) version</h1>
<p>I am Nicky Wrightson, Principal Engineer formally of <a href=https://www.skyscanner.net>Skyscanner</a> and of <a href=https:www.ft.com>FT</a></p>
<p>I have worked my ways through many industries - Travel, Telcomms, Financial Sector. Not surprisingly as I have been around for a while now I have been witness to many architectures - The good, bad and the ugly &mldr; I have contributed to <em>ALL</em> of those too!</p>
<p>Now in the systems I help build I optimise for operability, speed of delivery and/or cost. However all those three aspects are directly in conflict with each other, you <em>must</em> understand your requirements are to understand your compromises.</p>
<p>A little background drivel - I started life out at a consultancy. Then had a wild decade of contractoring globally which took me through the telcoms industry through to front-end office trading systems via some short stints in the music industry and other parts of the financial sector. I basically flip-flopped between perm and contract, learning skills then getting a contract wage from applying those. That journey is something I could write reams on in itself however I now can&rsquo;t really think of going back towards the contract market as I started to get passionate about aspects that I just could not fufill in contract roles.</p>
<p>I wanted to insitigate change for good - whether that be technical, social, process or organisational, as a contractor that was hard. Plus I was stuck in older tech teams within the financial services sector - My mind was yet to be blow to elastic compute and how we had so much more influence we had when we were working in the cloud.</p>
<p>However this realisation over what I enjoyed nor what what out there would have ever happened had I not been very heavily influenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlvN6tbU4dk">Sarah Wells</a> whom I had worked with at the very start of my career. She persuaded me to try out the Financial Times &mldr;. A blurry history on and here I am.</p>
<p>I was working as principal engineer at Skyscanner working on the data platform, fuelling the data driven decision making and machine learning. I walked into this role without understanding much about big data at all - which is actually why I chose to work in this field. When I made that choice I knew I had a lot to learn but what I didn&rsquo;t appreciate was that I would have to throw out nearly every comfortable design paradigm I had in my toolkit when you started talking about scale of circa 2 million messages per second.</p>
<p>This was a hard step up for me but at the end of the day I think that a principal&rsquo;s role should be able to switch between domains and definitely switch technologies. My view is that often there are several archetypes of a principal engineer - some might be deeply technically, domain specialised whilst others might be better at delivering longer term strategy exerting influence accross many squads/tribes or even further extending that influence outside the organisation to the wider tech community. I certainly at the moment fit into the later but find myself chaging roles depending on the organisation or even initiative. I plan to write more on this topic as a post &mldr;.</p>
