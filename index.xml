&lt;li>Bad Wifi in the house&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bought a ubiquiti unifi dream machine &lt;a class="link" href="https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/unifi-dream-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;li>I bought a draytek vigor 130 because you can&amp;rsquo;t put the sky router into bridge mode basically although there are benefits to&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>link:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>updated the UDM via unifi.ui.com to UDM
UDM 1.10.0.3686&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DrayTek setup:
Remove the SkyQ hub and plug all the DSL line into the new modem.
Power this up.
No internet for this =&amp;gt;You will want to hardwire a machine into the modem and browse to the modem management interface 192.168.2.1&lt;/p>
&lt;p>http://192.168.2.1 with a username of &amp;ldquo;admin&amp;rdquo; and a password of &amp;ldquo;admin&amp;rdquo; by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clicked enableMPoA &amp;amp; VCi changed to 101&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok and restart&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plug an ethernet cable from the DrayTek modem into the WAN port of the Dream Machine(DM). Power up the DM.Now… at this point if you are on the latest firmware and are on the same Superfast line such as I am on in England you could stop here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes? Nope didn&amp;rsquo;t work at the UDM is slowly flashing blue which apparently means that the UDM is connected via bluetooth&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now going to try and access vigor in bridge mode. Bridge mode means that it is purely acting as a modem. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.draytek.com/support/knowledge-base/5212" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.draytek.com/support/knowledge-base/5212&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and click on ‘Internet Access’ then ‘MPoA/Static Dynamic IP’ then click the ‘enable’ button. Click OK and then you may need to click OK again, bit odd as I seem to remember, the first OK kind of activates the settings then OK again to apply and restart. DrayTek’s own instructions are here: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.draytek.co.uk/support/guides/kb-vigor-130-bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.draytek.co.uk/support/guides/kb-vigor-130-bridge&lt;/a> The modem should now reboot. You can unplug your machine from the modem and continue, we are done here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Have to start somewhere</title><link>https://nickywrightson.com/p/have-to-start-somewhere/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nickywrightson.com/p/have-to-start-somewhere/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://nickywrightson.com/img/intro.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Have to start somewhere" />&lt;p>In August I left my role at Skyscanner to take a career break with an ambitious list of things I wanted to achieve before I started a new role. One of those items was to start a blog and get into a writing routine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are so many topics, ideas and opinions battling in my head and I have wanted a space to get them down in writing. Tech leadership, individual contributor career information, continious improvement, all things data, distributed systems but to name just a few topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This initial post is pretty much me working out the lowest effort design for the deployment of a static site via github actions and free hosting via Github projects &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
