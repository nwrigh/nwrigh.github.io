# TLDR; 

[My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-wrightson-b2707a1/) .... No emotional reasons behind my career choices lay here though!

# The long(er) version 
I am Nicky Wrightson, Principal Engineer formally of [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net) and of [FT](https:www.ft.com)

I have worked my ways through many industries - Travel, Telcomms, Financial Sector. Not surprisingly as I have been around for a while now I have been witness to many architectures - The good, bad and the ugly ... I have contributed to *ALL* of those too!

Now in the systems I help build I optimise for operability, speed of delivery and/or cost. However all those three aspects are directly in conflict with each other, you *must* understand your requirements are to understand your compromises. 

A little background drivel - I started life out at a consultancy. Then had a wild decade of contractoring globally which took me through the telcoms industry through to front-end office trading systems via some short stints in the music industry and other parts of the financial sector. I basically flip-flopped between perm and contract, learning skills then getting a contract wage from applying those. That journey is something I could write reams on in itself however I now can't really think of going back towards the contract market as I started to get passionate about aspects that I just could not fufill in contract roles.

I wanted to insitigate change for good - whether that be technical, social, process or organisational, as a contractor that was hard. Plus I was stuck in older tech teams within the financial services sector - My mind was yet to be blow to elastic compute and how we had so much more influence we had when we were working in the cloud. 

However this realisation over what I enjoyed nor what what out there would have ever happened had I not been very heavily influenced by [Sarah Wells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlvN6tbU4dk) whom I had worked with at the very start of my career. She persuaded me to try out the Financial Times .... A blurry history on and here I am.

I was working as principal engineer at Skyscanner working on the data platform, fuelling the data driven decision making and machine learning. I walked into this role without understanding much about big data at all - which is actually why I chose to work in this field. When I made that choice I knew I had a lot to learn but what I didn't appreciate was that I would have to throw out nearly every comfortable design paradigm I had in my toolkit when you started talking about scale of circa 2 million messages per second.

This was a hard step up for me but at the end of the day I think that a principal's role should be able to switch between domains and definitely switch technologies. My view is that often there are several archetypes of a principal engineer - some might be deeply technically, domain specialised whilst others might be better at delivering longer term strategy exerting influence accross many squads/tribes or even further extending that influence outside the organisation to the wider tech community. I certainly at the moment fit into the later but find myself chaging roles depending on the organisation or even initiative. I plan to write more on this topic as a post ....
